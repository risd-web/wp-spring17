					Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, /ˈrɪzdiː/) is a fine arts and design college located in Providence, in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. It has been ranked among the best art and design universities in the United States, while the QS World University Rankings by Subject ranked it as the world's 3rd best institution for the study and practice of Art & Design in 2016.[3][4][5][6] [7]</p>
					
					<p>Founded in 1877, it is located at the base of College Hill; the RISD campus is contiguous with the Brown University campus. The two institutions share social, academic, and community resources and offer joint courses. Applicants to RISD are required to complete RISD's two-drawing "hometest".</p>

					<p>It includes, on the Fall 2015 term, about 470 faculty and curators, and 400 staff members. About 2,014 undergraduates and 467 graduate students enroll from all over the United States and 57 other countries. It offers 16 undergraduate majors and 17 graduate majors. RISD is a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD), a consortium of thirty-six leading art schools in the United States.

					The Centennial Women[8] were a group formed to raise funds for a separate Women's Pavilion showcasing women's work at the 1876 Centennial Exposition.[9] In a little over a year the RI women raised over $10,000 with spectacles such a recreation of the burning of the Gaspee that drew a crowd of 9000, the writing and publication of a monthly newspaper, Herald of the Century, and an art exhibition. The Women's Pavilion at the 1876 Centennial successfully highlighted women's "economic right to self-sufficiency" and included exhibits from recently founded design schools, displays of new patents by women entrepreneurs, and a library containing only books written by women. The Rhode Island Centennial Women submitted their newspaper, Herald of the Century, to this Women's Pavilion's library.
				</p>

					At the end of the World's Fair, the RI Centennial Women had $1,675 left over and spent some time negotiating how best to memorialize their achievements.[9] Helen Adelia Rowe Metcalf proposed that the group donate the money to found what would become the Rhode Island School of Design, and this option was chosen by a majority of the women on January 11, 1877. The school was incorporated in March 1877[10] and opened its doors the following fall at the Hoppin Homestead in downtown Providence, RI.[11] Metcalf directed the school until her death in 1895. Her daughter, Eliza Greene Metcalf Radeke, then took over until her death in 1931.[12]

					The Rhode Island General Assembly ratified "An Act to Incorporate the Rhode Island School of Design" on March 22, 1877, "[f]or the purpose of aiding in the cultivation of the arts of design." Over the next 129 years, the following original by-laws set forth these following primary objectives:
					<li>The instruction of artisans in drawing, painting, modeling, and designing, that they may successfully apply the principles of Art to the requirements of trade and manufacture</li>
					<li>The systematic training of students in the practice of Art, in order that they may understand its principles, give instruction to others, or become artists.</li>
					<li>The general advancement of public Art Education, by the exhibition of works of Art and of Art school studies, and by lectures on Art.</li>
