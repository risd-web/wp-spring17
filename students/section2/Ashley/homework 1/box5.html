    		Blue Moon is an ice cream flavor with bright blue coloring available in the Upper Midwest of the United States. The Chicago Tribune has described the ice cream as "Smurf-blue, marshmallow-sweet, and tasting remarkably like Froot Loops and Fruity Pebbles". Blue Moon ice cream is one of the flavors which make up Superman ice cream. Blue Moon is found mainly in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio. It is found less frequently in Minnesota; North Dakota; Indiana; Iowa; Illinois; and Erie, Pennsylvania. (Information from Wikipedia)
