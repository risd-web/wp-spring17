		<div class="text">
		<div class="text1">
			The sharp cut of forgetting teenage angst. The moon reflects the craters on your face.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			Bildungsroman, cutting time, splicing DNA, wanting more, giving up.
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			Capitulation of space. Becoming aware. Lost in time. Memento mori. After this.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			Oxymorons of epistemology. But what is lost is never gone, and always recovered.
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			The one that was, will never be again. Dead skin cells accumulate under your bed.
		</div>
		<div class="text1">
			On my own terms. And once again, embarrassed. Shamed. Nothing will ever be the same again.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			The revival of an era. A revelation of the subjectivity of once established epistemologies.
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			Subjugation/subjectation. Object-oriented programming is a paradigm for the ages.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			As above, so also, is above the directionality of the saints of history.
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			The orientations that mark lines across the globe signify not only geography.
		</div>
		<div class="text1">
			The designations of relative industry points towards a blind future.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			Lines and lines and lines and lines and lines and lines and lines and lines
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			Once one makes bad choices it is hard to stop. Once one grows up it is hard to go back.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			Fake knowledge. Facetious categorizations. Matrices of power. Unknown factors.
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			Variable, mutable. I shed remorse like I shed personalities like I shed skin.
		</div>
		<div class="text1">
			I strive to practice a non-violent anti-colonialism.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			Only I am the expert of my own experience.
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			Moralistic crusades serve nothing but the new project towards universal literacy.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			Legal fictions pervade the atmosphere like clouds of mosquitos lying in wait.
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			Actualities and realizations are nothing but in the eyes of the beholder.
		</div>
		<div class="text1">
			Drawing from memories and ancient trauma, navigating the world on one leg.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			Anthologies that are not just anthologies but put texts in relation to their own terms.
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			Systems of hierarchies that serve as living legacies that outlive former carcasses.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			Vultures. Vultures? Scavenging the past to make sense of the future.
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			The present does not exist. The internet is dead. This is a fucking dialectic.
		</div>
		<div class="text1">
			Afterthought. Forethought. Nothing but. Accumulation.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			No hyphens. No concatenations. Only sensitivity, emotional resonance
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			Provicializing aesthetics requires the ability to step outside of one's body.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			Which political frameworks do you decorate your head with?
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			Defining the vernacular is impossible without hegemony in opposition.
		</div>
		<div class="text1">
			An accumulation of surfaces result in a three dimensional space.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			Dissatisfaction. Adolesence. Moral responsibilities to seek out truth.
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			Nothing is known and nothing can be known and nothing will ever be known.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			A gradual accumulation of discomfort. A persistant critique is needed.
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			Identity is always underpinned by the prescence of it's other.
		</div>
		<div class="text1">
			Every major knowledge carries within itself the possibility of a counteracting potential.
		</div>
		<div class="text2">
			A one to one relation does not and cannot exist. Do not trust metaphors.
		</div>
		<div class="text3">
			I am not present anymore. I am not the expert. I do not follow any orientations.
		</div>
		<div class="text4">
			Chaos and disruption are only step one. There must be more. Or else what's the point?
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			I will strive for my ideals while knowing I will fail.
		</div>
