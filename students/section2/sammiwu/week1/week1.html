            Well, I dreamed I saw the knights<br>level
In armor coming,<br>
Saying something about a queen.<br>
There were peasants singing and<br>
Drummers drumming<br>
And the archer split the tree.<br>
There was a fanfare blowing<br>
To the sun<br>
That was floating on the breeze.<br>
Look at Mother Nature on the run<br>
In the nineteen seventies.<br>
Look at Mother Nature on the run<br>
In the nineteen seventies.<br><br>

I was lying in a burned out basement<br>
With the full moon in my eyes.<br>
I was hoping for replacement<br>
When the sun burst thru the sky.<br>
There was a band playing in my head<br>
And I felt like getting high.<br>
I was thinking about what a<br>
Friend had said<br>
I was hoping it was a lie.<br>
Thinking about what a<br>
Friend had said<br>
I was hoping it was a lie.<br><br>

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver<br>
Space ships flying<br>
In the yellow haze of the sun,<br>
There were children crying<br>
And colors flying<br>
All around the chosen ones.<br>
All in a dream, all in a dream<br>
The loading had begun.<br>
They were flying Mother Nature's<br>
Silver seed to a new home in the sun.<br>
Flying Mother Nature's<br>
Silver seed to a new home.<br>

                I want to live,<br>
I want to give<br>
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.<br>
It's these expressions<br>
I never give<br>
That keep me searching for a heart of gold.<br><br>

And I'm getting old.<br>
Keep me searching for a heart of gold<br>
And I'm getting old.<br>

I've been to Hollywood<br>
I've been to Redwood<br>
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold.<br>
I've been in my mind,<br>
It's such a fine line<br>
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold.<br><br>

And I'm getting old.<br>
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold<br>
And I'm getting old.<br>

Keep me searching for a heart of gold.<br>
You keep me searching and I'm growing old.<br>
Keep me searching for a heart of gold<br>
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.<br>

            My my, hey hey<br>
Rock and roll is here to stay<br>
It's better to burn out<br>
Than to fade away<br>
My my, hey hey.<br><br>

Out of the blue<br>
and into the black<br>
They give you this,<br>
but you pay for that<br>
And once you're gone,<br>
you can never come back<br>
When you're out of the blue<br>
and into the black.<br><br>

The king is gone<br>
but he's not forgotten<br>
This is the story<br>
of a Johnny Rotten<br>
It's better to burn out<br>
than it is to rust<br>
The king is gone<br>
but he's not forgotten.<br><br>

Hey hey, my my<br>
Rock and roll can never die<br>
There's more to the picture<br>
Than meets the eye.<br>
Hey hey, my my.<br>
