<p><font size="10" face="helvetica" color="#0014ff">Hi, my name is Hyunjun Cho, and I go by Julie.
Currently, I am a junior Graphic design major student studying at Rhode Island School of Design.
I am from South Korea, spending 19 years of my life there, and came to the United States for studying Graphic design after my graduation from high school. So my native language is Korean and my second language is English.</font>

<h2><font size="5" face="proxima nova" color="#4d4d4d">Julie Cho's cyber room</font></h2> 
<p margin-right: 200px;><font size="2" face="helvetica" color="#0014ff">I designed my own portfolio website, introducing who I am as a graphic designer. Many people use website templates for presenting their portfolios, but I personally think the design of the website also can stand for one of the biggest parts of my design principle. The concept of my portfolio website is a ‘my personal room’. Screen-based works are mostly two dimensional, and sometimes it is very hard to bring spatial quality. For my portfolio website, I experiment with the idea of ‘space’ and explore more about how to bring the three dimensional aspect into web design. For my website, I put some materials that occupy my room, such as a green carpet,  flower printed beddings, a wooden long board, etc. This is a cyber version of my room which shows my personality and my lifestyle. Also, you can check my portfolios hanging on the wall.

During this spring semester, I learned how to manipulate digital space freely and professionally. Including learning technical skills and coding languages, I also learned how to build interactive website that user can experience.
