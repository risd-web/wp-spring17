      I spent the first decade of my professional career in the contemporary art world. I started out in publishing, moved to galleries, and then ended up in marketing and communications before I realized how much I like making things. Now, I am immersed in design at RISD's MFA in Graphic Design programme, and thrilled to be moving in a new direction. Obessessions are many and varied: crisp packaging, walking uphill, white spaces and voids, and staying hydrated.
