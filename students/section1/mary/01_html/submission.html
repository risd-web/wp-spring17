      		<p>Composition submission guidelines</p>
<ul> All genres welcome -- if you have any questions about how your style of music relates to these guidelines, please email us.</ul>
<ul>Unfortunately, we can't accept pieces that call for more than 5 instrumentalists/performers this semester unless the ensemble has already been organized at the time of submission </ul>
<p>Playability</p>
<ul>The music must be something that can be learned to performance quality by the average student musician within a reasonable amount of time. The amount of time spent should be 2-4 rehearsals plus 2-4 hours of individual work, totaling no more than 12 hours over the span of at least one month.</ul>
<ul>More difficult music can be accepted if the composer already has musicians who have learned or agreed to learn the piece and are capable of doing so</ul>
<ul>Each composer is limited to one piece per concert unless submitting a larger set of works. Total time should be 2-10 min.</ul>
<p>Pieces will not be considered if</p>
<ul>Lyrics, titles, or any written or spoken words insult or appropriate identity or experience around gender, race, ethnicity, religion, ability… </ul>
<ul>Inaccessible instrumentation (if no one at Brown plays it, we can’t perform it)</ul>
<ul>Unreadable or excessively messy scores/parts/lead sheets (we don’t expect composers to be formatting experts, but we do expect efforts to make the score and parts legible)</ul>
<p>Score and parts (when applicable) must be submitted in final-draft PDFs (no sibelius or finale files) </p>
<br>
<p>MIDI or recording appreciated but certainly not required</p>
<br>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>Composers writing for other musicians must be comfortable communicating with performers about scheduling rehearsals. If the composer is not comfortable directing rehearsals, someone from the Fermata board will be available to assist with directing the rehearsals.</ul>
<ul>Composer must be present for all rehearsals (if applicable) and the concert (April 15th)</ul>
