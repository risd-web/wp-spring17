    <h1> Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast </h1>

<section id="english text">
In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, Carl Dair showed how in typography, as in music, harmony and contrast are the keys to composition.


<div class="box">
<h2>Written by John D. Berry</h2>

<p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe -- and show -- the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>

<p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say "typographer": someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter, but someone who uses type, in all its variations, as the principle element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of typography requires a designer who cares about the words themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and is skillful enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve as simply eye-catching decoration.</p>

<p>Carl Dair's book "Design With Type" (originally published in 1952; revised and expanded in 1967) is deservedly still in print, even though the technology that he used and described has long been outdated. The practicalities of setting type in metal are no longer the practicalities we have to deal with; but the visual relationships between letters, which Dair showed and explained so graphically in his book, haven't changed at all. "Design With Type" is still one of the best handbooks available for learning how to do exactly what the title says: design with type.</p>

Seven Kinds of Contrast

Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship between the black strokes of the letters on a page and the space around them; and any rules, frames, or decorations being similar in style to the type), then goes on to show seven different kinds of contrast. He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation, it's important to make the contrast obvious -- not just a slight change, an almost imperceptible variation, but a really big, obvious difference between the contrasting elements.

<li>Contrast of Size</li>
<li>Contrast of Weight</li>
<li> Contrast of Form </li>
<li class="special"> Contrast of Structure</li>
<li> Contrast of Texture</li>
<li> Contrast of Color</li>
<li> Contrast of Direction</li>
Other Types of Contrast

<h3>Contrast of Size</h3>

The first and most basic contrast is size. "A simple but dramatic contrast of size," says Dair, "provides a point to which the reader's attention is drawn. Set in the same style of type, it maintains the exact relationship of the letter to the background. It is only a physical enlargement of the basic pattern created by the form and the weight of the type being used for the text." The most common use of size is in making the title or heading noticeably bigger than the text -- but that's only a starting-point.

<h4>Contrast of Weight</h4>

The second most obvious contrast is of weight: bold type stands out in the middle of lighter type of the same style. As Dair points out, "Not only types of varying weight, but other typographic material such as rules, spots, squares, etc., can be called into service to provide a heavy area for a powerful point of visual attraction or emphasis."

The next two kinds of contrast are the contrast of form and the contrast of structure. It's not entirely obvious where to draw a line between these two, since they both have to do with the shapes of the letters.


<h2>Contrast of Form</h2>

By "form," Dair means the distinction between a capital letter and its lowercase equivalent, or a roman letter and its italic variant. He includes condensed and expanded versions under "form," and he even allows as how "there are some script types which harmonize with standard types, such as the Bank Script and Bodoni on the opposite page, and can be used for dramatic change of form." (He warns, parenthetically, against using scripts and italics together, since they are both versions of handwritten letters; they're more likely to conflict than to contrast.)

<h2>Contrast of Structure</h2>

By "structure," Dair means the different letterforms of different kinds of typefaces -- a monoline sans serif vs. a high-contrast modern, for instance, or an italic vs. a blackletter. "The use of contrast of structure may be compared to an orator who changes his voice not to increase or decrease the volume, but to change the very quality of his voice to suit his words."

<h2>Contrast of Texture</h2>

Put all these things together, and apply them to a block of text on a page, and you come to the contrast of texture: the way the lines of type look as a mass, which depends partly on the letterforms themselves and partly on how they're arranged. "Like threads in cloth," says Dair, "types form the fabric of our daily communication."


<h2>Contrast of Color</h2>

Dair's sixth contrast is color -- and he warns that a second color is usually less emphatic than plain black on white (or white on black), so it's important to give careful thought to which element needs to be emphasized, and to pay attention to the tonal values of the colors used.

<h2>Contrast of Direction</h2>

The last of Dair's seven kinds of contrast is the contrast of direction: the opposition between vertical and horizontal, and the angles in between. Turning one word on its side can have a dramatic effect on a layout. But Dair points out that text blocks also have their vertical or horizontal aspects, and mixing wide blocks of long lines with tall columns of short lines can also produce a contrast.

   （时间的算法是个很奇妙的东西）
一天可以很漫长一天也可以短暂到一眨眼就到日落
之前吃饭时候看到大家手机里都有倒数回国的日子
我知道有些人是真的每一天可能都在数日子 有些是每天盼着，偶尔拿出来看看。

可是时间到底是怎样过去的真的不好说。和喜欢的人在一起时间过的飞快 三天一眨眼就过完了，距离回国的日子顺其自然的从49天变成了46天
这是一个人过日子的时候完全没体会过的迅速

前几天到楼上朋友宿舍称体重 她圣诞的时候没回家 说是现在天天数着日子过觉得特别难熬 而且有时候熬了夜睡一觉起来 看到倒数日的天数是没有变化的 就觉得更难熬了



我有个特别好的闺蜜，虽然聊天少了，生活圈子不一样了，但还是彼此能很信任的那种，她曾经跟我说“大概你就是那种主动类型的人吧，我总是很被动。” 事后这么多年我也不能很确切的说自己是个主动的人还是很被动的。
有时候是真的有要忙不完的事 project due paper due 
还记得绅士的品格里说的那句话，但
其实接纳自己是件不容易的事情，特别是对一些有些追求高，对自己有要求的人更难。

看社交网络越多看到各种各样人的观点越多，得到的相对论就越多
甚至有些观点两极分化到让你无法选择 也不知道谁说的对
也许你会说啊我就按自己的想法来

但人总归是有侥幸心里的

薛定谔的年，还记得有次哥哥带我去吃甜品，就是汉街的lady7，也是大大的环形落地窗和软软的沙发（往下一看有种特别知道什么是人头攒动的感觉）
我很想念着那样和亲爱的人做在一家餐厅里，不紧不慢的，吃吃饭，说说话。直到现在我都记得 和当时我倆发给姐姐看的场景照片里那温和静谧的阳光和落地窗。


前几天在微博上看到“英雄的兼职”一个系列小插画
小英雄们做些平凡人也会做的洗衣做饭事情的时候 是那么可爱


记得之前听电台节目 有一段诗我特别喜欢
一个湖可以看一天
一盆火可以望一晚
一个人可以想几十年
时间

还是很容易在数着回家的日子里又感叹大块时间的流失

怎么就快大一结束了呢？
最想念的上学时光还是初中哪些日子
