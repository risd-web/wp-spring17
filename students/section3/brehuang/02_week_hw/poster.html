        <p>Josef Muller Brockmann</p>
        <h2 id="a">Born on May 9, 1914, Müller-Brockmann grew up in Rapperswil, Switzerland. He attended the prestigious schools to study architect, art and design, including University of Zurich and the city’s Kunstgewerbeschule. His first step toward a professional career was his apprenticeship to Walter Diggleman, the designer and advertising consultant. In 1936, he opened his own Zurich studio which specialized in photography, graphics and exhibition design. Over two decades he established his position as the country’s leading practitioner and theorist of Swiss Style. He created a universal graphic expression employing a grid-based design exclusive of subjective feeling and extraneous illustration. In 1951, he created “Musica viva” poster for the Tonhalle’s music concert. The poster drew on the language of Constructivism to create a visual correlative to the structural harmonies of the music.</h2>
