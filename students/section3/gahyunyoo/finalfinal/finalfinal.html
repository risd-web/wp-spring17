	<h2> <br> <br> <br>Kimchi Jjigae (김치찌개) or kimchi stew is a stew-like Korean dish, made with kimchi and other ingredients, such as scallions, onions, diced tofu, pork, and seafood. Pork and seafood are generally not used in the same recipe. It is one of the most common and popular jjigae in Korea. Kimchi jjigae is often cooked in Korean homes using older, more fermented and ripe kimchi, creating a much stronger taste and containing higher amounts of good bacteria. The stew is said to be more flavorful if prepared with older kimchi, while fresh kimchi may not bring out a full and rich flavor. Kimchi is the most important ingredient in kimchi jjigae. Other ingredients depend on personal preferences.
