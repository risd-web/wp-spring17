Text to text Edward Hopper and Roald Dahl</a>

If memes were a thing when Edward Hopper was alive, many of the subjects in his paintings probably would have passed this one around on their social media accounts: “I used to think the worst thing in life is to end up alone. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.”</p>



<p>

In a 2000 review, Grace Glueck described Hopper as a “master of loneliness” whose barren landscapes, silent interiors, and pensive figures convey “a haunting emptiness.” The desolation becomes most unsettling in those pieces that depict ostensibly intimate situations; Hopper veils his couples’ expressions from us and one another with his indistinct brush strokes and moody shadows.

Edward Hopper suggests rather than conveys, and his characteristic restraint compels us to rifle through the oppressive ambiguity for unspoken truths or hidden secrets. In Roberta Smith’s review of ‘Hopper Drawing’ at the Whitney, she explains how viewers want “to get behind the curtain of Hopper’s stillness and figure out what’s going on,” which explains why countless artists, filmmakers, and writers have been riffing on Hopper’s work for years.

It is also what makes Hopper so appealing in a high school E.L.A. classroom. Integrating any art into literacy instruction is easy because it so effectively proves to students that the more they look, the more they see — an essential point that is less easily made with written text. Hopper’s work in particular is a gold mine for readers who need to practice inferencing, because the truths are whispered, not shouted, and students really need to lean in to hear them.

To model for students the process of intertwining visual art and storytelling, we pair Hopper’s “Room in New York” (1932) with Dahl’s “Lamb to the Slaughter.” Dahl’s juxtaposition of domestic banality with an unforeseen act of violence is pure Hopper, and students love it.

For one thing, they don’t have to look too far to recognize the many inter-textual connections. Like Hopper’s “Room in New York” couple, Dahl’s characters are in a relationship that is both insufferably claustrophobic and deeply disengaged. Hopper’s couple could have modeled for Dahl’s twisted tale of vengeance. Readers don’t see any of it coming, and neither do the characters.

Both pieces poke at what simmers beneath the placid surface of ordinary lives, and what they unearth is darkly disturbing. How well can we really know the people with whom we share our lives? What secrets are they concealing from us? If familiarity breeds contempt, as these two texts suggest, is being alone really the worst thing? Maybe not, if the alternative is living with someone who decides to smash your head in with a slab of frozen mea
